Drew Naylor's Website
=============

This is an attempt to port my Drew Naylor Emulation website to ~~GitHub~~ Codeberg Pages (this may take a bit; mainly doing this for documentation but also because I want my website here too). Note that if you're reading this on GitHub, this is the mirror and it's mainly on Codeberg but the website is still built from GitHub for now. Need to figure out how to move over the subpages for different repos.
