  <h2>About this Blog</h2>
  <p>This is where I talk about general things related to this website and reveal new apps, if there are any. Please note that I manually added links to each archived blog post here, and I didn't want to have to also copy some of each blog post's text and the posted date. This is why they're just plain links, unlike <a href="/blog/" target=_blank>my main blog</a>.</p>
