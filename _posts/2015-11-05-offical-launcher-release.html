<p>Note that I haven't actually made an entire changelog on <a href="http://www.drews-apps.weebly.com" target=_blank>my new site</a>, but I did post there that the apps are available. Go to my GitHub Releases pages to download them, along with source code!</p>

<p>I've been working on my GitHub account for the past week almost. Development on these apps was actually started in 2013 but I have only gotten them released for the public.

I will be posting screenshots soon.</p>
