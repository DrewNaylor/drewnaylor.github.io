<p>A source familiar with the inner workings of Twitter, now known as X, reported that in a recent internal discussion, 
  Elon Musk decided to rethink calling Tweets "X's", and suggested a better name could be "Divorces". 
  "We were thinking that you could have Divorces, so why not have Redivorces, too? People sometimes get married
  multiple times and decide that who they were previously with wasn't good enough for their superior intellect, right?"</p>
<p>Our source also stated that Elon Musk is mulling over making ratios an official feature of X, with Elon again
  deciding a good name could be "Disowns". "It could help me get over my [daughter; we don't want to be canceled
  here in our news room] deciding [she; again, we'd rather not be canceled] doesn't think I'm a good father, which
  is just a silly idea to begin with. I mean, who could be a better father than the guy that named his son a bunch
  of random numbers and letters? Don't tell anyone I said that about naming it 'Disowns', I need to pretend I'm 
  smart and not a malignant narcissist who repels family members." "Disowns" will also reportedly become competitions
  to see who can "Disown" a post the fastest, with the winner receiving a substantial bounty of a new cryptocurrency
  planned to be introduced for X named "Xcoin". Users will be able to send "Xcoins" to other users' "Xboxes", which
  is basically a bank account for storing "Xcoins". Elon says this quote "won't get me in trouble with regulators
  or Microsoft, I'm sure," end quote.
