<p>Hello everybody, this is Drew Naylor and I'm testing out how Jekyll sorts posts if they're set to be posted later in the day or in the future otherwise. Please note that this post was originally created on April 23, 2017, at 1:00 AM EDT.</p>

<p>Update: As it turns out, nothing happened other than having the post date change. I would have hoped that it would at least hide the post until the date I said it was made.</p>

<p>Since you're here, I guess I could link to my online accounts, if you want to see my stuff. You don't have to if you don't want to:</p>
