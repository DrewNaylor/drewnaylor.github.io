<p>Whoah! Double post! I'm sure you weren't expecting that at all! Anyway, click on the "Read More" link below to read the entire article.</p>


<p>Today, I decided to implement a Search bar into my Web site. First I was looking at the Google Custom Search page since I knew that existed. Then, I decided to search Bing for Bing Custom Search and it turns out that it takes a lot of work. So then I decided to search for DuckDuckGo (DDG from now on) custom search, just to see if they had anything like that. It turns out that, yes, they do have a free service for that! I put in my information I wanted the search bar to use and this is what it looks like:</p>




<hr>
<br>

<p>Because of how Custom Search works with DDG, it does not show the results on the website. From the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/search_box" target=_blank>DDG Custom Search page</a>: <i>"Because of the way <a href="https://duck.co/help/results/sources" target=_blank>we generate our search results</a>, we do not have the syndication rights to allow you to host our results on your site (e.g. in a frame). When your users click on the results they will be instead taken to our site."</i></p>


<p>So, how does it look? My goal is to have this search box be on every page, even unlinked pages that are not archives. </p>

<p>Please leave feedback in the comments. Note that I must pre-approve comments before they will show up on my website.</p>
