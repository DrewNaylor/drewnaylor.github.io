<p>UPDATE: The Roms page is now relisted in my site navigation bar. I tried to do it on the 13th, but I didn't get around to it.
<br>
In memory of Satoru Iwata, I am hiding the Roms page on my site for one month starting today, July 13 until August 13. On August 13, I will unhide the Roms page.</p>
