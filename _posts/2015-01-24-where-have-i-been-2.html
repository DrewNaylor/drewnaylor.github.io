<p>Please note that the following paragraph has been directly copied from my YouTube account.

<p>Attention everyone: I have restored the Windows Update videos today. The reason I haven't been posting videos lately is because I kinda got bored of YouTube. So, I am still alive, just in case you were concerned. I do plan on making more videos in the future, but I'm not really working on any right now.</p>

<p>I finished building my computer last September. It runs Linux Mint 17.1 with 8GB of RAM and 750GB of storage. It has a 3.4 GHz Intel Core i3-4130 processor with an Asus Z87-A ATX motherboard. As for videos, I do have some recordings on the PC of testing SSR and recording interesting things I see in Minecraft.</p>


<p> I do have some video ideas in a text document on my laptop. On my wall in my office I have some more ideas such as an intro idea for a series I might make. The series might be unprofessional, (hint hint!), but I'll try my best to make them entertaining, because if "Cat Fails" can be entertaining, this should be as well.</p>

<p>Sometime in the future I might be buying a wind instrument that became popular around 1998. Once I learn some songs on it, I'll probably make videos of it. But that won't be for at least 2 months. I really need to figure out some sort of content to record and upload to upload. Maybe I should make a video on OpenBroadcastSoftware...</p>
