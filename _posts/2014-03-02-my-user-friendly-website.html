<p>Today, I updated my Website. I have moved videos into their own categories, especially for Dolphin Emulator. I have also condensed the Navigation bar at the top of every page. I have hidden things that are not needed any more (you can still get to the now-unlisted pages by typing in their URL if you remember,) and removed some links that no longer work. Please enjoy my new Website layout and please send feedback to me; it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!</p>
