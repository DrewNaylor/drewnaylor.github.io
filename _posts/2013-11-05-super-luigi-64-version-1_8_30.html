<p>I have finally gotten a version of my ROM hack, "Super Luigi 64," released to commemorate the "Year of Luigi"! This had been my goal ever since I heard that 2013 was the "Year of Luigi". There is now an icon of Luigi in the HUD in place of Mario, among other changes. The ".30" in the file name is specifically for this occasion; 2013 is the 30th Anniversary of Luigi (1983-2013). The link to it is under the "ROMs" page, in the first category. I will be making a video for it soon.</p>
