<p>All I had to do was republish my site. Apparently I messed up my More... drop-down nav button so that nothing would show up when I mouse over it. Please tell me if there is anything else broken and I will fix it when I get the time. If it's major, I'll work on it as soon as I have free time. You can contact me on my Contact Me page under the More... drop-down box, or at the address below if that stops working again:

</p>

<p>You can also contact me via a comment on one of my videos on  
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIEyCGDqoo2rrfZVydaM-2A" target=_blank>YouTube</a>, or via a post on <a href="http://www.facebook.com/DrewNaylorYoutube" target=_blank>my official Facebook page</a>.
</p>

<p>A report on broken stuff would be greatly appreciated. Also, please detail how to reproduce the bug on my website, as well as pages which exhibit the bug. Thank you.</p>

<p>-Drew</p>

<p>UPDATE 4/13/2016: If you want to report a bug on THIS site, please <a href="https://github.com/DrewNaylor/drewnaylor.github.io" target=_blank>file an issue on my GitHub repository</a>.</p>
