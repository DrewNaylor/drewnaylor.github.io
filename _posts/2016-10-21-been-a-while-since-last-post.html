<p>I've been working on YouTube videos for both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIEyCGDqoo2rrfZVydaM-2A" target=_blank>my main</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVk9yYuTvmUSs56Sjxq2rLQ" target=_blank>my secondary</a> YouTube channels as well as working on software on GitHub! If you're reading this on my <a href="http://drewnaylor.github.io" target=_blank>GitHub site here</a>, then you probably already know that site is hosted on GitHub, mainly because I link to the repository in a bunch of different places. If not, you're probably reading this on Weebly.

Something important to say is that I made the numbers for the titles on the Videos pages for Mario 64 Secrets 003 and 004 look better by copying the formatting trick I did for the 002 and 001 titles. That includes the bonus video titles as well. Note that I don't yet have video embeds on <a href="http://drewnaylor.github.io" target=_blank>drewnaylor.github.io</a> which I want to do some time.</p>
