<p>As the title states, from now on I will no longer be distributing Rom (Z64 or V64 etc) files and will be distributing all hacks in BPS patch format! If you don't know what BPS patches are, you can refer to <a href="http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=viewthread&t=73147&page=1" target=_blank>this page on SMW Central</a>.</p>
<p>What this means is that it will no longer be as simple as just downloading a hack from my site and running it immediately. Fortunately, it's easy to create patches using BPS and even easier to patch a ROM to play! All my links on my Roms page have been updated with links to ZIP packages containing a Readme file, the patch, a Project64 configuration tutorial, and a copy of the patcher (along with the license for it.)</p>
