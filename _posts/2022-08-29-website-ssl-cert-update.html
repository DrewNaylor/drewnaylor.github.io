<p>Just writing a quick blog post to let everyone know that I've switched my website to using Google's default nameservers and the "force HTTPS" option in the GitHub Pages settings, so that a Let's Encrypt certificate is now being used for HTTPS on my website instead of Cloudflare's one. What does this change offer you? Well,</p>

<ol>
<li>The peace-of-mind that I'm not using a service that (last I checked) is the registrar for, hosts part of, and protects a hate forum (this is enough reason to dump Cloudflare on its own, but there are more things I want to list)
<li>Fewer cookies due to not having Cloudflare's stuff here
<li>Probably better security in transit from GitHub to Google (my domain registrar, because I weirdly enough trust Google to not mess with me regarding my domain) since I don't think there's a chance for data to go over HTTP, unlike when I was using Cloudflare (due to how it had to be done when GitHub Pages didn't offer HTTPS for custom domains)
<li>Slightly unrelated, but I'm also using DNSSEC now, and that's being provided by Google
</ol>

<p>I thought Cloudflare would've acknowledged the problem and dropped them sooner, which is why I waited as long as I did to drop them. Plus I thought there would be a lot of work involved, but it was actually really easy. I feel uneasy about the idea of naming that forum because it just gives me a bad feeling, so I don't really want to take the chance of typing their name out.</p>
