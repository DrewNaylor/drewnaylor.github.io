<p>Today I would like to announce my release of version 0.5 of my application! There are lots of improvements to it, including but not limited to being a portable application and including an installer. See the new "Changelog" file for details. I still need to add stuff to the "About" page. "TabPage1" contains nothing. Screenshot:</p>

</div>

<p>Most requirements are the same, but the installer will tell you how much space you need.
