<p>Recently I made a blog post about <a href="https://drew-naylor.com//blog/2017/changing-feed-generation-method" target=_blank>changing the feed generation method</a> which included switching to RSS instead of Atom because it seems to work a little better for me. However, that's not all I've done to improve this site recently. Below are some other things that weren't mentioned in that original blog post.

<br>
<br>
</p>

<h2>Custom Domain</h2>

<p>That's right! This website now has its own domain name instead of using the GitHub Pages subdomain. Previously, this site's domain name would be <a href="https://drewnaylor.github.io" target=_blank>https://drewnaylor.github.io</a>, but now it's <a href="https://drew-naylor.com" target=_blank>https://drew-naylor.com</a>. I had to retype the old domain name because I didn't have a screenshot of it before getting my new one. Old domain name:

<br>


<div style="text-align: center">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/2017/old-domain-name-lowercase.png" target=_blank>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/2017/old-domain-name-lowercase.png" width="226" alt="URL from old RSS generator." /></a>
<br>
<small>^ It's free, but is a lot to remember.</small>
</div>

<br>

<p>But now, I'm just using an <a href="https://github.com/snaptortoise/jekyll-rss-feeds/blob/master/feed.xml" target=_blank>XML document</a> to generate my RSS feeds and it seems to be working well so far. Much better than jekyll-feeds. Here's the result of this generator:
</p>

<br>

<div style="text-align: center">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/2017/new-domain-name-lowercase.png" target=_blank>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/2017/new-domain-name-lowercase.png" width="217" alt="URL from new RSS generator." /></a>
<br>
<small>^ Short and terse. Easy on the memory.</small>
</div>

<br>
<br>

<p>I'll have to post more about this in the morning, but until then, I'll be happy that my RSS feed works now!</p>

<p>UPDATE 5/5/2017:

<br>
<br>

Wondering if I would ever update this blog post? Wonder no more as that's what I'm doing right now! In addition to making the RSS feed actually work, I've also made the sitemap work which will be talked about in another post which I want to write very soon about recent improvements on the site. Until then, you can subscribe to my RSS feed to be aware of any new posts.</p>
