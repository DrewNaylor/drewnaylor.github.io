<p>Today I would like to announce the first release of my first program, Drew's Application! It does not sound like much but sometime I will make the title better. Here is a screenshot:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/2013/drews-app-0_1.png" target=_blank>
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/2013/drews-app-0_1.png" width="502" alt="Drew's Application version 0.1." /></a>
</div>
<br>

<p>This application is currently just an "About" screen. In future versions there will be more things.
<br>Here are the requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Windows XP SP3 or higher
	<li>32-bit or 64-bit
	<li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Google it. First result.)
	<li>Processor: Pentium 1 GHz or higher with 512 MB of RAM or more
	<li>Minimum disk space: (Needed for the .Net Framework)
	
	<ul>
		<li>x86 (32-Bit) – 850 MB
		<li>x64 (64-Bit) – 2 GB
	</ul>
	
	<li><b>Prerequisites: (For the .Net Framework 4)</b>
	
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=889482fc-5f56-4a38-b838-de776fd4138c&displaylang=en" target=_blank>Windows Installer 3.1</a> or later
		<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/downloads/ie/getitnow.mspx" target=_blank>Internet Explorer 5.01</a> or later
	</ul>
</ul>

<br>
<p>I need to fix this. I have made a newer version and with this release I will have all of the needed files since I know what they are. I will also just put the files after installation into a ZIP file.</p>
