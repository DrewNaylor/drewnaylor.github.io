<p>Today I would like to announce the first release of my first program, Drew's Application! It does not sound like much but sometime I will make the title better. Here is a screenshot:</p>

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/blog-images/2013/drews-app-0_1.png" width="502" alt="Picture of version 0.1 of Drew's Application." />
</div>
<br>

<p>This application is currently just an "About" screen. In future versions there will be more things.
<br>Here are the requirements:</p>

	<li>32-bit or 64-bit
	<li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4 (Google it. First result.)

		<li>x64 (64-Bit) – 2 GB
	</ul>
