<p>Have you ever had something that you didn't want anymore so you take it to a second-hand store? It probably feels nice to get rid of some stuff and clean your house, but have you ever been given the <b>exact same one</b> as a gift from someone you don't know? Well, that recently happened to my mom. Click on "Read More" below to continue reading.</p>

<p>One of her friends told her about someone who needed help cleaning their house. So she started cleaning their house a few days ago for a few hours a day. The other day, the owner of the house gave her a painting that he bought from a local thrift shop. Turns out, that is the <b>exact same one</b> as the painting my mom and I took to that same store a few years ago.</p>


<p>So remember, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.</p>

<p>P.S.:  Yes, I know I have not posted anything in a while, (almost four months), but I also haven't done much with my website since my last blog.</p>
<p>P.P.S: If anyone accessed my website around 7 o'clock, you may have noticed a different favicon than usual. That was an experiment for my Nana's website.</p>
