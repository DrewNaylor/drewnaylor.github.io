<p>I won't go too much into actual politics in this blog post, but I wanted to post this somewhere. Last night as I was getting my toothbrush around to brush my teeth, I realized that many people who claim to be Christians have been turning away lately. The most common reason? trump's language and disrespect for people. (I think this is one of the most common reasons I see when it relates to him; other reasons include them deciding that God didn't create the universe so they become atheists, but that's not what I'm talking about today.) What I want to talk about is how trump <b>claims</b> to be a Christian (acronym: "CINO", "Christian In Name Only") but most of his actions and words don't even come close to being similar to Christ. For example, he's vulgar, greedy, hateful, lazy, selfish, disrespectful, abusive, lies frequently, and maybe a few other things I can't think of right now. When some people who claim to be Christians (I don't know if they actually are Christians or they're pretending, but if they only say they are, they still need Jesus) see what trump is saying on Twitter (I won't link it for the sake of everyone's lunch), some reply and say that they're no longer Christians because of trump.</p>

<p>Why do I think this is such a big deal? It's mostly because it's entirely possible that Satan is taking advantage of the fact that trump, someone who I personally <b>can't see any presidential qualifications in</b>, is currently in the office of President. After all, trump <b>claims</b> to be a Christian and even went as far in the 2016 campaign to put something to the effect of him being chosen by God to lead the US on the yard signs for his campaign. He sure was chosen by God, but I don't think it was for him to lead (he's gotten away with a lot of things in the past, so maybe putting him in a public position with more responsibility is part of God's plan for punishment.) Thus, with him claiming to be a Christian and still being vulgar (and everything else mentioned above), it doesn't surprise me that Satan would decide to take advantage of the situation to try to steer away some people from God. All I want is for people to be aware of this possibility so that they're not misled like many people have been.</p>

<p>This doesn't even mention all the other sources of people claiming to be Christian but not acting like it. The Republican party has, for a while, been acting greedy, while the Democratic party has started to look more Christlike in (most of) its actions. Neither party is perfect, and there are quite a few things I disagree with the Democrats on, but at least their candidate for the 2016 election was respectful in the debates and in public. I don't know what Hillary Clinton said in private (for all I know, she could be vulgar, too, but I'm not claiming that), but at least she wasn't disrespectful to disabled people (I still can't get that horrible image of trump mocking the disabled reporter out of my head).</p>
