<p>I won't go too much into actual politics in this blog post, but I wanted to post this somewhere. Last night as I was getting my toothbrush around to brush my teeth, I realized that many people who claim to be Christians have been turning away lately. The most common reason? trump's language and disrespect for people. (I think this is one of the most common reasons I see when it relates to him; other reasons include them deciding that God didn't create the universe so they become atheists, but that's not what I'm talking about today.) What I want to talk about is how trump <b>claims</b> to be a Christian (acronym: "CINO", "Christian In Name Only") but most of his actions and words don't even come close to being similar to Christ.
