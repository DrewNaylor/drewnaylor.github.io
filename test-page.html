<h2>This is a test page, mainly for the Mario mouse JS thing.</h2>

<p>Here's how I did it (the right way) :</p>

<ol>
  <li>Made a file called <code>MarioFollowsCursorScript.js</code> in the <code>js</code> directory in the root of my website.
  
  <li>Placed the JavaScript code from <a href="http://rainbow.arch.scriptmania.com/scripts/elastic_pumpkin.html" target=_blank>here</a> into the <code>MarioFollowsCursorScript.js</code> file, with modifications to use Mario sprites and help from my friend, Dustin Herl, (for the original modifications,) and removed the <code>script</code> tags.
  
  <li>Made a new file called <code>ShowMarioCursor.html</code> to house the HTML from the modified Rainbow Arch code and placed it in the <code>_includes</code> directory. At the bottom of the document I placed a <code>script src</code> tag that references the <code>MarioFollowsCursorScript.js</code> from earlier.
  
  <li>Put an <code>include ShowMarioCursor.html</code> tag (surrounded by % and {}) at the top of this page, but below the Jekyll page markup stuff with the 3 dashes.
</ol>

<p>I moved the sprites to this website quite a while ago.</p>
