<h2>Welcome to Drew Naylor's website!</h2>
  
<p>Hello! My name is Drew Naylor. Recently I decided to port my Weebly website to GitHub Pages and, well, I did. Back in 2011 I decided to start editing Super Mario 64 with my good friend, Dustin Herl. His web site was also created with Weebly; mine was originally as well but now it's on GitHub Pages using the <a href="https://github.com/chrisanthropic/slim-pickins-jekyll-theme">Slim Pickins Jekyll theme</a>.
I have Gameshark cheat codes, links to ROM hacks (In BPS Patch format), links to editors, links to emulators, and even a blog!</p>

<h2>Basic features include:</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Jekyll 3.0 Compatibility</li>
    <li>SASS</li>
    <li>Minimal Foundation Zurb 6 integration</li>
    <li>Responsive grid</li>
    <li>Responsive navigation</li>
    <li>Optional full-width banner</li>

    <li>Basic SEO</li>
  </ul>
