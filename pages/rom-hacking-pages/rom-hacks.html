<h2>ROM Hacks</h2>

<p>This is the ROM Hacks page. I have listed the hacks in a bulleted list so that it will be easier to download them. They are now in BPS patch format to keep Nintendo happy. If you have any problems with me hosting ANY of these hacks, please contact me (drewnaylor_apps AT outlook DOT com) and we can work something out before just reporting these files.</p>

<p>The following hacks are ones that I have made.
(Please contact me if you want an older version of the Super Luigi hack):</p>
