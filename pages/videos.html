<h2>Welcome to the Videos page!</h2>

<p>On this page, you can watch videos that I have made which do not fall into any categories. If a video disappears from this page and it hasn't been deleted off my YouTube channel, don't worry; it's probably been moved to one of the categories below. I don't update the list below often, however, so I recommend that you click the links below to go to specific video categories.</p>

<p>Please note that it might be a while for me to place my videos on this page due to having so many pages originally on my old site. In the meantime, you can click the links below to check out my YouTube channels.</p>
