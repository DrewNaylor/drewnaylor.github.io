<h2>Welcome to the Videos page!</h2>

<p>On this page, you can watch videos that I have made which do not fall into any categories. If a video disappears from this page and it hasn't been deleted off my YouTube channel, don't worry; it's probably been moved to one of the categories below. I don't update the list below often, however, so I recommend to hover your mouse over the "Videos" button above to see all the video pages!</p>
