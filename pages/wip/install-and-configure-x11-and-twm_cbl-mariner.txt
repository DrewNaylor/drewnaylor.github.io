This page is a work in progress and will become its own blog post for easier reference. A lot of this information is thanks to Jonathan Pho's work, as linked in this comment thread: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p5foo1INhk&lc=Ugxf35EMKFcHMBobHv94AaABAg

I'd also like to acknowledge NTDev's efforts in getting X11 to work on CBL-Mariner.

<B>Note:</B> Jonathan Pho mostly used Linux From Scratch, but didn't use their "./configure" flags.


1. Install X11/Xorg Server partially using the steps from Linux From Scratch: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/xorg-server.html
  A. Run <code>sudo dnf install mariner-repos-ui</code> to add the coreui repo.
  B. Pixman should already be installed. If not, install "pixman" by running <code>sudo dnf install pixman</code>.
  C. Install font-utils by running <code>sudo dnf install xorg-x11-font-utils</code>.
  D. Install XKB.
    I. Download the package by running <code>wget https://www.x.org/pub/individual/data/xkeyboard-config/xkeyboard-config-2.33.tar.bz2</code>
	II. Extract the package by running <code>tar -xvjf xkeyboard-config-2.33.tar.bz2</code>
	III. CD into xkeyboard-config-2.33
	IV. Run <code>./configure --disable-runtime-deps</code>, <code>make</code>, and <code>sudo make install</code>.
  E. Installing Xorg Server
    I. Download the package by running <code>wget https://www.x.org/pub/individual/xserver/xorg-server-1.20.13.tar.xz</code>
	II. 
5. Install graphics drivers/packages
  A. "mesa"
    I. It appears that "mesa-dri-drivers" is the package to install.
  B. "drm"
    I. There are some DRM packages mentioned in the coreui repo, so some might work. Not sure which ones, so I'll have to figure that out.

6. Install "twm" (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/twm.html)
  A. Download this package: https://www.x.org/pub/individual/app/twm-1.0.11.tar.xz
  B. Compile it
  C. Install it
7. Install "xterm" (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/xterm.html)
  A. Download this package: https://invisible-mirror.net/archives/xterm/xterm-368.tgz
  B. Compile it
  C. Install it
  D. You also need a monospace TTF or OTF font to run xterm, such as Dejavu fonts: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#dejavu-fonts
  <b>Note:</b> "dejavu-sans-mono-fonts" is a package that exists in the "coreui" CBL-Mariner repo.
8. Install "Xinit" (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/xinit.html)
  A. Download this package: https://www.x.org/pub/individual/app/xinit-1.4.1.tar.bz2
  B. Compile it
  C. Install it
  
After installing "Xinit", "startx" should now be installed, so you can use it to run X11.
