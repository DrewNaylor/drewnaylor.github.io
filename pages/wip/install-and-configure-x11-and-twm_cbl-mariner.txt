This page is a work in progress and will become its own blog post for easier reference. A lot of this information is thanks to Jonathan Pho's work, as linked in this comment thread: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0p5foo1INhk&lc=Ugxf35EMKFcHMBobHv94AaABAg

<B>Note:</B> Jonathan Pho mostly used Linux From Scratch, but didn't use their "./configure" flags.

After installing Xorg Server from coreui repo as shown in part 2:

0. Install development packages so that we can build the X11 drivers
  A. "xorg-x11-server-devel" (https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=121647)
  B. "libXext-devel"
1. Install graphics drivers
  A. "xf86-video-vmware" since we're using VMware, though the instructions should work for other X11 drivers (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/svn/x/x7driver.html#xorg-vmware-driver)
    I. Make a new folder to keep everything in its own area: <code>mkdir x11-installing</code> (or whatever you want the folder to be; "x11-installing" is just an example)
    II. CD into the folder you made.
    III. Download the package by running <code>wget https://www.x.org/pub/individual/driver/xf86-video-vmware-13.3.0.tar.bz2</code>
    IV. Extract the package by running <code>tar -xvjf xf86-video-vmware-13.3.0.tar.bz2</code>
	V. CD into "xf86-video-vmware-13.3.0"
    VI. Compile it by running <code>./configure</code>, then <code>make</code>
    VII. Install it by running <code>sudo make install</code>
	VIII. Run <code>sudo depmod -a</code> (https://mesa-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/vmware-guest.html)
	IX. 
  B. "drm"
    - There are some DRM packages mentioned in the coreui repo, so some might work.
  C. "mesa"
    - Mesa packages exist in the coreui repo, so they might work. Not sure which ones to use, though.
	- "mesa-dri-drivers" may be the package to install.
  D. "vmwgfx"
    - May require installing based on LFS instructions.
  - DRM and Mesa might auto-install alongside Xorg Server
  - Not sure about the exact package names
3. Install VMware/X11 mouse drivers so the mouse works in X11.
4. Install "twm" (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/twm.html)
  A. Download this package: https://www.x.org/pub/individual/app/twm-1.0.11.tar.xz
  B. Compile it
  C. Install it
5. Install "xterm" (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/xterm.html)
  A. Download this package: https://invisible-mirror.net/archives/xterm/xterm-368.tgz
  B. Compile it
  C. Install it
  D. You also need a monospace TTF or OTF font to run xterm, such as Dejavu fonts: https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/TTF-and-OTF-fonts.html#dejavu-fonts
  <b>Note:</b> "dejavu-sans-mono-fonts" is a package that exists in the "coreui" CBL-Mariner repo.
6. Install "Xinit" (https://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/systemd/x/xinit.html)
  A. Download this package: https://www.x.org/pub/individual/app/xinit-1.4.1.tar.bz2
  B. Compile it
  C. Install it
  
After installing "Xinit", "startx" should now be installed, so you can use it to run X11.
