<p>I have released a preview of 2.8 of my app launcher. Note that it's buggy. I'm not planning on using this site for future update notifications, so I've set the URL of the Version History buttons on the About page to the GitHub releases feed. I'll make one final update notification on this site when 2.8 is complete.
