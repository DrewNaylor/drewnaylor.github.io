<p>This text was mostly copied from my GitHub releases page because Weebly is frustrating.

I made this release so that people could know to visit my GitHub profile just in case bloople.net ever goes down. Download the file titled "internal-changelog-pages.zip" at the page below this text. After the 1.5 KB download is finished, extract the archive and follow the instructions in the included text file titled "where-to-find-internalpgs.txt." Note that this release does not contain a newer version of my app launcher although you can download the current source on Master below and build it yourself if you like. It's not stable yet, though. Even if you don't want to upgrade your app launcher version on your computer, at least upgrade the internal changelog pages files, please.
