I use the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target=_blank>Gnu GPL version 3+</a> as the license for my applications. If the application has branding that I don't want other people to use, I apply "Drew's Modification Exception," ("DME") along with the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html" target=_blank>Gnu GPL v3+</a>. If you go to my GitHub page</a>, open one of the repositories for programs, and open the file called "LICENSE," you can read the GPL v3+ and the Exception, if I applied the Exception to that software. Alternatively, you can click on any of the links below to go directly to the repositories (folders) :</p></div>
