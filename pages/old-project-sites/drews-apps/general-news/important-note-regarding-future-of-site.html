<p>I'm planning on not using this particular site (drews-apps.weebly.com) for future update notifications. Because of that, the Version History buttons on the About page of my app launcher now direct the user to the GitHub releases feed, starting with version 2.8 Snapshot Preview 1 of my app launcher.</p>

<p>Note that this isn't my only website; my old weebly site is here: <a href="http://drewnayloremulation.weebly.com/" target=_blank>http://drewnayloremulation.weebly.com/</a> <br>
and my new GitHub Pages site is here: <a href="http://drewnaylor.github.io/" target=_blank>http://drewnaylor.github.io/</a></p>
