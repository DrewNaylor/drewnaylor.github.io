<h2>Archived pages and projects</h2>

<br>

<p>Below, you'll find links to old pages and projects I've worked on in the past, but haven't posted online before.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./mitty-website/myweb_ghpages.htm" target=_blank>Mitty website (modified for GitHub Pages)</a><br>
<li><a href="./mitty-website/myweb.htm" target=_blank>Mitty website (original)</a><br>
</ul>

<p>These are some older websites I made that I have decided to archive so I don't have to rely on Weebly keeping them online.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="./dnguide/index.html" target=_blank>Drew's Super Mario Galaxy 2 Guide</a><br>
<li><a href="./drews-apps/index.htm" target=_blank>Drew's Applications</a><br>
</ul>
