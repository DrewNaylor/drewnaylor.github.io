<h3><i><b>Engine Room</b></i></h3>
<p>After you complete the main objectives Spin-Dig Galaxy, the Spin Drill appears in the Power-up gallery.<br>
Also, Mailtoad appears on the top of the ship.<br>
The Cloud Flower appears when the main objectives in Fluffy Bluff Galaxy are finished.</p>

<br>

<h3><i><b>Starship Mario</b></i></h3>
<p>Yoshi is unlocked after the first star in Yoshi Star Galaxy is collected.<br>
After you finish the game the first time, Luigi is unlocked. Follow the stream of water up from the pool on the bottom of Starship Mario (it should look like a green spot with railings around it). Then, walk into the green doors.<br>
The first letter from the Mailtoad includes a 1-Up Mushroom.</p>

<br>

<h3><i><b>World Map</b></i></h3>
<p>In the World Map, after you feed the Hungry Luma &lt;Edit Later&gt; star bits, he will transform into Flip-Swap Galaxy. After you complete the first star, you can advance. Behind the Galaxy Icon, there is a Star Bit Cluster. Simply run into it to collect it.</p>
